Here is an example of using the or condition inside the find method of Mongoose:

```javascript
const user = await User.find({$or: [{region: "NA"}, {sector:"Some Sector"}]});
```

This will find all users in the "NA" region or "Some Sector" sector.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

Here is an example of how you can store payment transactions in MongoDB using Mongoose:

```javascript
const paymentSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  fromUser: {
    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    ref: 'User',
    required: true
  },
  toUser: {
    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    ref: 'User',
    required: true
  },
  amount: {
    type: Number,
    required: true
  },
  date: {
    type: Date,
    default: Date.now
  }
});

const Payment = mongoose.model('Payment', paymentSchema);
```

This schema defines a payment transaction with the following fields:
- fromUser - the user who is making the payment
- toUser - the user who is receiving the payment
- amount - the amount of money being transferred
- date - the date of the transaction

You can then use this schema to create a new payment transaction and save it to the database:

```javascript
const payment = new Payment({
  fromUser: 'user1',
  toUser: 'user2',
  amount: 1000
});

payment.save();
```

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
